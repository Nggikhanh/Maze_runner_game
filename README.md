# Maze_runner_game

Rogue-like is a special type of video game. Whenever these games reset, their maps are randomized, which refreshes the players' experience for each playthrough, presenting them with unexpected surprises. Inspired by this sense of adventure, we are determined to build a program to create randomized mazes and let users solve them. In addition, the algorithms in this project can be the foundation of future and more complicated projects involving constraint satisfaction problems and navigation like auto-driving cars or even path-finding rescuers.
